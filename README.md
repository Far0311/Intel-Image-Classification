# üß† Intel Image Classification

This notebook contains the **source code and documentation** for a deep learning project that classifies natural scene images into six categories ‚Äî **buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea,** and **street** ‚Äî using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, **ResNet50**, and **EfficientNet-B0** architectures.

## üìò Project Description
This project demonstrates how computer vision and deep learning can be used to **automate scene recognition**.  
The work is focused on applying machine learning techniques for image classification.

The included **PDF file (`Intel Image Classification.pdf`)** provides:
- Complete code snippets for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  
- Explanations of the methodology, dataset, and model selection process  
- Results from **Optuna hyperparameter tuning**  
- Visualizations of performance metrics and loss curves

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** [Intel Image Classification Dataset ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)  
- Contains over **25,000 labeled RGB images** across six scene classes.  
- All images are resized to **150√ó150 pixels** and normalized for CNN input.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Implemented
1. **Simple CNN** ‚Äî Baseline model trained from scratch  
2. **ResNet50** ‚Äî Transfer learning with frozen feature extractor  
3. **EfficientNet-B0** ‚Äî State-of-the-art architecture optimized for accuracy and efficiency  

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using **Optuna**, optimizing:
- Learning rate  
- Weight decay  
- Dropout rate  
- Optimizer type (Adam / SGD)  
- Batch size and momentum (for SGD)
